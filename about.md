I'm a Rhys Short, an Aberystwyth Univeristy alumnus. Currently employed as a
Software engineer / Code Wrangler at IBM Cloudant. I primarily develop and
maintain the set of client and mobile sync libraries for Apache CouchDB/ IBM
Cloudant.

Recently I've wrangling swift code to create [SwiftCloudant][sc] Cloudant's
newest client library.
