My day job at IBM is developing CouchDB Sync libraries for Java, Android and Objective-C. Alot of this tends to be working with JSON and cURL in the terminal. One of the tools Iâ€™ve found useful ( and wish I knew of sooner) is [JQ](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/). JQ is a handy tool for processing JSON received from a CouchDB instance. JQ is self styled as the sed for JSON. It is a really powerful tool which allows you transform JSON data in various ways.

For example if you have a large number of databases and you wish to bulk to delete them, you need to be able to get the list in an easy processable way. I have a [fish](http://fishshell.com/)Â function:  
```
function delete-db
    for $db in $argv
    eval curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5984/$db
    end
end
```

it takes a list of databases to delete, then deletes from the local couchdb server. The problem is getting a list of databases when there is a large list, for this I wrote this JQ:

```
[.[]| if startswith("_") | not then . else empty end] | reduce .[] as $dbs (""; . + " "+ $dbs)
```

the above function will turn the JSON array returned by CouchDB into a space separated list.

Note: In order to get JQ to print out the result without quotes around stings, you need to use the -r option

JQ is really useful, you should look at the documentation to see how powerful it is, although it has some quirks like if statements much have an else, hence the `empty` keyword.

Disclaimer: This post is mostly for my benefit so I donâ€™t lose my JQ function or what it does ðŸ˜‰
