**IBM Cloudant, 1 The Square, Temple Quay, Bristol  
**Software Engineer  
 July 2014 – Present

I work as part of a small development team building IBM Cloudant’s Mobile Offerings, these are predominantly sync libraries for iOS/OS X (CDTDatastore) and Java/Android (sync-android). This has recently been expanded to including a local version of Cloudant Query (CloudantQueryObjc), operating on documents stored using CDTDatastore.

 

 

**IBM, Hursley Labs, Hursley**  
 Industrial Trainee  
 June 2012 – July 2013

Industrial year placement working on IBM Websphere MQ. Working initially as part of the UI team; developing MQExplorer, I was later reassigned to work as part of the pervasive team working to deliver updates to the MQTT support in MQ. During this time I was responsible for assisting in the development of an Android sample Application, to demonstrate the use of MQTT on the android platform, eventually I became the owner of the sample and the internal test material for the Paho MQTT Java Library. Along with the build process for the sample application and the test material. During my time at IBM as an industrial trainee I learnt valable lessons such as the importance of continuous integration and testing, along with better programming practice.

**Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, Wales**  
 Demonstrator  
 October 2011 – May 2012

Demonstrating modules for first year computer science students. Along with a team of fellow demonstrators, run practical sessions in which we solve Java  
 programming problems. Along with solely running practical sessions for students studying basic commands and tools of UNIX. Through my demonstrating duties I have become better at debugging code written by somebody else, and being able to communicate the problems with various pieces of code and how to fix the problem effectively. Through this I helped first year computer science students gain a solid foundation in programming.
